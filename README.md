The role of the interaction network in the emergence of diversity of behavior
Authors: Godoy, Tabacof & Von Zuben

## Abstract

How can systems in which individuals' inner workings are very similar to each
other, as neural networks or ant colonies, produce so many qualitatively
different behaviors, giving rise to roles and specialization? In this work, we
bring new perspectives to this question by focusing on the underlying network
that defines how individuals in these systems interact. We applied genetic
algorithms to optimize rules and connections of cellular automata in order to
solve the density classification task, a classical problem for decentralized
computation. The networks used were all generated by the introduction of
shortcuts in an originally regular topology, following the small-world model.
We observed the existence of different classes of cells' behaviors in the best
cellular automata found -- most cells were responsible for memory and others
for integration of information --, even though all cells follow the exact same
rules. Through the analysis of structural measures and patterns of connections
(motifs) in successful cellular automata, we observed that the distribution of
shortcuts between distant regions and the speed in which a cell can gather
information from different parts of the system seem to be the main factor for
the specialization we observed, demonstrating how heterogeneity in a network
can create heterogeneity of behavior.
